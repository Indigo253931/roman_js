# Touch of Class!

## Objective
Your luxury brand is wanting to make the pontential buyers and gawkers feel more impressed by converting all of 
the quantity information to roman numeral. 

Create a function that accepts an integer as an argument. It should than convert that number into its [roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) equivalent.

```
2499 = MMCDXCIX
543 = DXLIII
13 = XIII
```

### Pseudo Code!(10m)

We recommend you pseudocode for the first 10 minutes. Start writing down/typing how to break this problem down.

### Stating the obvious

You are looking for an algorithm that will calculate a Roman numeral.  Simply creating a massive conversion chart that includes all numbers is, well, simply painful.

### Bonus

- How clear is your code?  Is it obvious where you support the subtraction cases (IV, IX, etc)?  Does your code reflect your vision of how you, personally, calculate Roman Numerals?
- Create a web page that converts roman numerals
